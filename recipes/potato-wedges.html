    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, oven fries don't have to be forgettable.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray, for the baking sheet</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds (1.1 kg) russet potatoes, washed and scrubbed</li>
        <li>2 quarts (1.9 L) water </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (25 g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Pour oil over baking sheet and tilt until evenly coated with oil. Using a sharp knife, halve potatoes lengthwise. Place potato halves cut side down on cutting board and cut lengthwise into 1- to 1 1/2-inch-thick wedges (3 to 4 wedges per half potato, depending on size). </li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil over high heat. Add salt, baking soda, and potatoes and stir to combine. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until potatoes are barely tender, offering some resistance when poked with a paring knife or cake tester (the texture should be similar to that of a firm poached pear or lightly cooked apple), about 7 minutes from when potatoes are added to the pot. Drain potatoes, taking care not to break the wedges, and transfer to a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Season potatoes with salt and pepper and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the surface of the wedges. Transfer wedges to prepared baking sheet, arranging them in a single layer with one flat cut side down, and space between each piece.</li>
        <li>Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, until potatoes are golden brown on bottom side, 18 to 22 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula, flip potatoes onto second flat cut side and continue to roast until golden brown on second side, 18 to 22 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Transfer baking sheet to a heatproof surface, season wedges with salt and pepper to taste, and toss on baking sheet to evenly coat. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and blot away excess oil. Discard paper towels and serve with your favorite condiments.</li>
