    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This easy French Toast recipe is the BEST, with a thicker batter and cinnamon sugar flavors that really set it apart. It's one of our family's favorite breakfasts!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>8 thick slices bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F or or heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>In a blender, add the eggs, milk, flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Blend until smooth. If you prefer whisking by hand, start by mixing the flour and eggs together in a shallow dish, then whisk in the rest of the ingredients until combined.</li>
        <li>Dip bread slices into the batter, dredging them well on both sides, and place on hot, greased griddle or skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the breads starts to get golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side the same.</li> 
        <li>Remove to a plate. Serve warm with syrup and a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</li>
    </ol>
