# The Odin Project Exercise - Recipes
This was the first web development, specifically HTML language, exercise that I did for the Odin Project Course. The content in this readme would describe what this exercise was and what I learned from it.
## What is this?
By using HTML language, I attempted to create a barebone web page consist of links to several recipes. This hopefully showed how I used different HTML elements and their attributes to make some recipes.
